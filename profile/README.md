### Trust our code, not our promises

We believe that technology should protect fundamental digital rights. In a world that has normalized tracking, profiling, and behavioral prediction, privacy has been reduced to a privilege for the few - not a right for everyone. Modern software silently collects, analyzes, and monetizes personal data, turning individuals into products without their knowledge or consent.

We reject that future.

By design, every system we build empowers people to reclaim control over their information - their thoughts, conversations, identities, and digital footprint. With the rise of cryptography and privacy-respecting engineering, it is now possible to build tools that do not need to exploit users to sustain themselves. These protections can be encoded directly into the code — open to review, transparent to all, and impossible to hide behind marketing.

This is the Codecx way. By opening our source code, we ensure that our users remain independent from us and from intermediaries. They have the ability to verify, compile, and run every component on their own machines, without surrendering ownership of their data to any corporation. This guarantees uninterrupted access to their tools and information — without surveillance, lock-ins, or data extraction.

We envision our products as part of an open privacy-driven ecosystem, where the community is free to contribute in many forms: writing code, building extensions, auditing security, designing privacy-centric interfaces, or translating documentation so that freedom is accessible to everyone.

Because digital freedom shouldn’t be something users hope for -  
**it should be guaranteed by the software itself.**
